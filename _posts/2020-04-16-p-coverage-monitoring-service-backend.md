This project aims to propose a back-end solution to monitor at a high resolution the capacity coverage for a critical dispatch service such as an emergency service.

By <span style="font-weight: bold">capacity coverage</span>, we mean the information relying on: _How many teams can reach any point of a jurisdiction within a given timeframe?_
<br><br>

Below are examples of how this information could be used by a dispatch application or a monitorig application:

<div class="row">
<div class="col grid s12 m6">

</div>

This project will need one or more machine learning models to estimate accurately the routes. For that purpose a [data challenge](https://challengedata.ens.fr/challenges/21), with the [ENS Paris](https://challengedata.ens.fr/), is under way and a compiled solution will be published under the following repo: [https://github.com/ds4es/unit-response-oracle](https://github.com/ds4es/unit-response-oracle).
